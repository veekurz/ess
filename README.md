This script is useful for quickly searching for individual conformations among a large number of LOG files. For example after the optimization + freq. analysis of structures generated by KICK (for stochastic conformational search) 
https://kick.science/KICK.html
https://www.cup.uni-muenchen.de/oc/zipse/teaching/computational-chemistry-2/topics/kick/

requirements:

Your log files to analyse are in the same directory
Each log file was generated for the corresponding com/gjf file of "opt+freq" type, for example:
#p ub3lyp/6-31G(d) EmpiricalDispersion=GD3 opt=(MaxCycles=250) scf=tight int=finegrid

title

0 1 X Y Z

--Link1-- #p ub3lyp/6-31G(d) EmpiricalDispersion=GD3 scf=tight int=finegrid geom=check gues=read freq pop=NPA' >> temp1

title

0 1

Each LOG file should contain the same compound (compounds in case of molecular clusters) and as a consequence:
Number of atoms and their numeration in should be the same!
Excel sheets explaining the principle of the method are in /scr7/vasily/scripts/schwerpunkt/principle.ods (or .xlsx, .xls)

Test Input example /scr7/vasily/scripts/schwerpunkt/test1_INP Test Output example /scr7/vasily/scripts/schwerpunkt/test1_OUT

How it works:

cp -r /scr7/vasily/scripts/schwerpunkt/test1_INP your_files #copy recursively /scr7/vasily/scripts/schwerpunkt/test1_INP to your_files

cd your_files/test1_INP

og #(Output Gaussian) will give you useful information from all LOG files #/scr7/vasily/scripts/Ausschreiben

ess #Energy Sort Script will find conformers/tautomers/isomers by Energy Difference Criterion of 0.026255 kJ/mol #/scr7/vasily/scripts/kick/ess

schwerpunkt #uses results obtained from 'ess' to find geometrically individual structures #/scr7/vasily/scripts/schwerpunkt/schwerpunkt
